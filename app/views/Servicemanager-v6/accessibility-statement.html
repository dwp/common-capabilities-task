    Accessibility statement for DWP Task
  </h1>

 

  <p>This accessibility statement applies to the DWP Task application</p>
   <p> This application is run by the DWP Task team. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this application. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
<p> 
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">   
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>Update a customer's bank details</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-accessible">How accessible this application is</h2>
<p>We know some parts of this application are not fully accessible:</p>
<p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">   
        <li>content relationships are not always communicated</li>
        <li>links do not always have accessible text </li>
        <li>instructional content for user input is sometimes missing or incorrect</li>
        <li>some content has not been coded, for example empty state content</li>
        <li>focus is not always set to the status message, so status messages are not always announced after you perform an action</li>
        <li>our text is not as simple as possible to understand</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="feedback-contact">Feedback and contact information</h2>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="enforcement">Enforcement procedure</h2>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).</a></p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="technical-information">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
<p>DWP Task is committed to making its application accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="compliance">Compliance status</h2>
<p>The application has been tested against the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</a> AA standard.</p>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="non-accessible">Non-accessible content</h2>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
<p>Some of the content relationships are not communicated in code, so people using a screen reader cannot easily understand how one content type relates to another. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)</p>
<p>Some links do not have visually hidden text, so people using a screen reader will not be able to understand the purpose of the link. This fails WCAG success criterion 2.4.4 (Link purpose).</p>
<p>Some content does not have instructions or guidance to help people understand what to do at user input. Some instructional content is incorrect. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.3 (Labels or instructions).</p>
<p>Some of our content is not programmatically determined. Where content is missing, people using a screen reader cannot easily understand all of the content. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name Role value).</p>
<p>Some of our status messages are not announced, so people using a screen reader cannot easily understand what has happened following their action. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status messages).</p>
<p>We plan to implement all fixes by March 2025.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
<p>Some of our text is not as simple as possible to understand, which impacts readability and the ability of the user to understand content. Some content has been coded in kebab case, lower case connected by hyphens. Some screen reader users, for example those using JAWS, will be affected, as every word and hyphen will be read out loud.  WCAG 2.2 does not provide any guidance for this kind of content.
</p>
<p>We plan to implement a solution for content to appear normally to users by March 2025.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="preparation">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
